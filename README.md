## Introduction
Mount Everest, at 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7ft), is the world's highest mountain and a particularly desirable peak for mountaineers,but climbing it can be hazardous.More than 300 people have died attempting to reach the summit. Most deaths have been attributed to avalanches, falls,serac collapse, exposure, frostbite, or health problems related to conditions on the mountain.

## Problem Statement
1. At what altitude did most sherpa deaths occur?
2. What was the most cause of deaths for sherpa?
3. Between male and female gender, which had the most deaths?
4. What Year had the most deaths recorded?
5. Which country had the most deaths?
6. How many sherpa bodies were recovered?
7. At what altitude did the most Moutaineers deaths occur?
8. what was the most cause of deaths for mountaineers?
9. Between the male and female gender, which had the most deaths?
10. Compare the deaths that occured while climbing as opposed to while coming down, which had the most deaths?
